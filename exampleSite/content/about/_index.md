I am a full-stack web developer with more 5 years of experience, specialized in (but not limited to) Ruby on Rails and React.js

I enjoy improving my skills every day, working on interesting projects for awesome clients.

Working as a remote freelancer I have delivered production-ready apps and made contributions to ongoing projects for companies located in Australia, the USA, and Germany.

Besides programming, I enjoy listening and playing music, making digital art, reading books and traveling whenever I can.
